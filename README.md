# Assignment #1: Prerequisite Checker

Do you have all the prerequisites you need to apply for the BAS in Application Development at North Seattle College? Write a script that lets users enter courses they have taken to find out if they qualify. Here are the prerequisities: http://webshares.northseattle.edu/AD-BAS/Program%20Planning%20Sheet.pdf

For purposes of this assignment, it will be enough if your checker supports courses from NSC. Checking for transfer credits from Central or South is not required. All, you checker only needs to focus on specific programming and IT course requirements. For other requirements (English, math, general education, other), your checker can just ask one blanket question: "Have you completed all other required courses?" Your checker should give helpful feedback to students about which requirements they have already satisfied and which courses they still need to take. Turn in this script as a single file called Checker.html.
